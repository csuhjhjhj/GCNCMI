# Introduction
Interactions between circular RNAs (circRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to alter gene expression and regulate disease genes. Most circRNA-miRNA interactions remain largely unknown because traditional experimental approaches are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Developing computational methods to explore the interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs at scale could help bridge this gap. In this paper, we propose a graph convolutional neural network-based method named GCNCMI to predict potential interactions between circRNAs and miRNAs. GCNCMI first mines the latent interactions of adjacent nodes in a graph convolutional neural network, and then recursively propagates the interaction information on the graph convolutional layers. Finally, it combines the embedded representations generated by each layer to make the final prediction. In five-fold cross-validation, GCNCMI achieved the highest AUC of 0.9312 and the highest AUPR of 0.9412. In addition, case studies on two miRNAs, hsa-miR-622 and hsa-miR-149-5p, showed that our model has a good effect on predicting circRNA-miRNA interactions.
